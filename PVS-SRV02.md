# Proxmox in MS-01 13900H

### Setup
* Nginx Proxy Manager LXC
* Docker/Samba LXC
  * Immich
  * NextCloud
* Jellyfin LXC
* Plex

### Hardware
* MS-01
* 4 NVME Drives (3 4TB + 1 512GB) 
* JetKVM
* USB Drive for local Backups

### Storage Config 

Approach is as follows:

1. PCIe 4.0 x4:
WD_BLACK SN850X NVMe SSD 4TB
Primary storage for CTs, VMs, Home Assistant, Nextcloud, and other high-performance services.
2. PCIe 3.0 x4:
ORICO i7500 NVMe SSD 4TB
3. PCIe 3.0 x2:
ORICO i7500 NVMe SSD 4TB
4. Mini PCIe 2230 Key A+E 3.0 x2:  
Kingston NVMe SSD (512 GB) in WiFi Slot
Dedicated to Proxmox OS.

Configuration:

Use the two ORICO i7500 SSDs in a ZFS Mirror.
The Proxmox OS stays isolated on the Kingston 512GB SSD.

### Steps
1. Download ISO and Create bootable USB
2. Install Proxmox
3. Connect disks
4. Download debian template
5. Create Docker/Samba container
6. Create mirror pool
7. Attach mirror pool to the Docker/Samba container
8. Setup the Docker/Samba and other LXC

### Proxmox Tools

1. Proxmenux → https://macrimi.github.io/ProxMenux/

To install ProxMenux, run the following command in your Proxmox server host:
```sh
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MacRimi/ProxMenux/main/install_p
```

Once installed, launch ProxMenux by running:
```sh
menu
```

### Setting up Storage for the MS-01
One mirrored ZFS pool from NVME 2 and 3 with 2 4TB Orico drives.
One single disk 4TB out of a WD Black 850 in slot 1 for performance. (Will solve for redundancy later).

In ZFS tab, press "Create: ZFS". Name it → Do not add Add Storage → Choose raid configuration → Compression: lz4 → ashift: 12 → Hit "Create"
lets add some datasets from the host shell:
```sh
zpool list
```
and
```sh
zfs list
```
can show you what pools are available.
Create the following: 
```sh
zfs create blaze/backups && zfs create blaze/isos && zfs create blaze/vms
```
 
## Create Boot Drive and Install

> Use `diskutil` or balenaEtcher.

### Installation
1. Select the destination.
2. Select country, time zone and keyboard layout.
3. Set your password and email.
4. Set your network settings.

## Docker in a generic Linux Container (LXC)
> 12GB RAM, 200GB HD, 4 Cores

### Setup steps
1. Press the `Create CT` button.
2. Enter the host name and password, then press `Next`.
3. Select the debian template.
4. Select the storage pool, and set the disk size.
5. Select the number of cores.
6. Set the memory limit.
7. Set the network settings.
8. Set the DNS settings.
9. Confirm and press `Finish`, do NOT start the container.

> Set the container as unprivileged and enabling `Nesting`, `NFS` and `SMB/CIFS` in `Options`.

### Creating the media pool and adding it to the main node

> In case force is needed for mirror
> ```
> /sbin/zpool create -f <commands>
> ```

```sh
# List ZFS
zfs list

# Create a pool
zfs create mzp/media

# Limit (Optional)
zfs set quota=100G mzp/media

# Set the mountpoint for 102 container
pct set 100 --mp1 /mzp/media,mp=/mnt/media

# Set permissions
chmod -R 777 /mzp/media
```

### Creating the main user for Docker/Samba

Update and install `sudo` and `curl`
```sh
apt update && apt upgrade
apt install sudo curl
```

Add the main user, replace `ea` with your own
```sh
adduser ea
```

Adding the user to sudoers
```sh
usermod -aG sudo ea
```

Get your ip address
```sh
ip address
```

### Seting up Docker with the main user

With the newly created user, login using the remote terminal
```sh
ssh ea@10.1.1.103
```

Install docker, replace `ea` with your own
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker ea
```

### File sharing

Install Samba
```sh
sudo apt install samba
```

Create your sharing directory in the zpool path
```sh
cd /mnt/media && mkdir nas guests
```

Create your Samba user
```sh
sudo smbpasswd -a ea
```

Edit Config
```sh
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Set the `/etc/samba/smb.conf` like this:
```sh
[global]
   # General server settings
   workgroup = WORKGROUP
   server string = Debian Samba Server
   security = user
   map to guest = Bad Password
   guest account = ea
   
   # macOS compatibility
   server min protocol = SMB2
   server signing = auto
   client min protocol = SMB2
   client max protocol = SMB3

   # Logging (optional, for debugging)
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
   max log size = 1000
   logging = file

   # Performance tweaks (optional)
   socket options = TCP_NODELAY IPTOS_LOWDELAY

[Guests]
   path = /mnt/media/guests
   writable = yes
   browsable = yes
   guest ok = yes
   read only = no
   create mask = 0666
   directory mask = 0777
   force user = ea

[MyNAS]
   path = /mnt/media/nas
   writable = yes
   browsable = yes
   valid users = ea
   guest ok = no
   read only = no
   create mask = 0666
   directory mask = 0777
```

Restart Samba
```sh
sudo systemctl restart smbd
```

Shares file structure
```
|-- guests
`-- nas
	|-- movies
	|-- photos
	`-- shows
```

## Immich in Docker LXC

Download the Docker compose file
```sh
cd && mkdir immich && cd immich
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/latest/download/docker-compose.yml
wget -O .env https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/latest/download/example.env
```

For external libraries, edit the `compose.yml` and add the path for the external library
```sh
nano compose.yml
```

From this:
```yaml
  volumes:
    # Do not edit the next line. If you want to change the media storage location on your system, edit the value of UPLOAD>
    - ${UPLOAD_LOCATION}:/usr/src/app/upload
    - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
```

To this:
```yaml
  volumes:
    # Do not edit the next line. If you want to change the media storage location on your system, edit the value of UPLOAD>
    - ${UPLOAD_LOCATION}:/usr/src/app/upload
    - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    - /mnt/media/nas/Pics:/import/pictures
```

Install and run
```sh
docker compose up -d
```

Update by connecting trough ssh
```sh
cd immich && docker compose down -v && docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```
